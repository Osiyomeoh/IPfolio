# 🌍 How IPfolio Impacts the Average Person

## The Problem: IP Investment is Only for the Rich

### **Current Reality**
- **Music Producer:** Has great songs but needs $5,000 for studio time → Can't access it
- **Small Investor:** Wants to invest in music but needs $10,000+ → Too expensive
- **Creator:** Waits 6-12 months for royalty payments → Can't pay bills today
- **Fan:** Loves an artist but can't financially support them → No way to invest

**Result:** Only wealthy investors and institutions participate in the $300B+ IP market.
